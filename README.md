## My process
I create html template first after that I started stylin components one by one.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript ES6
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how can I add JavaScrit functionalities. It helps me alot in understanding eventlistener function of JS & how can we edit and modify website via DOM.
